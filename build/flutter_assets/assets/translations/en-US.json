  "home1": "Hi, I'm Hyunjin Kim, a mobile application developer.",
  "home2": "I would like to develop user-centered services\nthrough better experiences and concerns.",

  "about1": "As well as learning experienced in school and society,\nI have always challenged new fields with the goal of creating something on my own.",
  "about2-1": "Hello, I'm Hyunjin Kim, a mobile application developer.",
  "about2-2": "The company I'm currently working for is C# and SQL Server in the automobile FA industry. However, due to the nature of the FA industry, the customer-centered environment had to prioritized answering customer calls, business trips, and maintenance over development, and I thought there was a limit to developing the ability I wanted as a developer.",
  "about2-3": "So after work, I started learning Flutter and Firebase on my own, which I was interested in, to find an opportunity to grow myself.",
  "about2-4": "It was difficult to implement because it was the first project to be developed, but after refactoring such as code improvement and state management introduction, I'm now aiming to release it this year.",
  "about2-5": "Also, I'm developing a mobile application all alone using Flutter and Google Cloud Platform for distribution to customers.",
  "about2-6": "There was a difficulty in solving everything alone because there was no one in the company doing related tasks. However, even when I was a student, I knew that when I challenged a new field and tried to overcome it, I could finally see the answer, and based on that experience, I reached a level that I could be satisfied with myself.",
  "about2-7": "I had a lot of worries, but now that I decide to make a new start, I hope it will be an opportunity to work with co-workers with more experience and skills than I do fill in the gaps. I came back far away, but now I hope it will be an opportunity to learn user-centered service development."
